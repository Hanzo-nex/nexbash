Mr. Bougo's Nexuiz-Bash interaction system.

First of all, be aware that scripts are only triggered by the user. That
means you can't use it to make aimbots or whatever silly things.
It can't be used to trigger commands with events.

This system rather extends the power of the DarkPlaces console with
bash scripting.

To see how nexbash scripts work, have a look at the "scripts" directory.

To use the system, you will need to configure .nexbash/nexbash.sh . The
instructions on how to run it are stored there too.
